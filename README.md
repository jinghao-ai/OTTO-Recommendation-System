# OTTO-Recommendation-System
⭐ OTTO – Multi-Objective Recommender System

A complete 7-day intermediate Kaggle project

📌 Overview

This repository contains a structured and modular 7-day workflow for the Kaggle OTTO Multi-Objective Recommender System competition.
The goal is to build a recommender system that predicts three types of user interactions:
	•	clicks
	•	carts
	•	orders

using large-scale session-based e-commerce logs.

This project is built to be:
	•	Beginner-friendly (clear code + explanations in English, comments in Chinese)
	•	Modular (each day has its own folder + README)
	•	Kaggle-ready (optimized for Kaggle GPU/TPU/CPU environments)
	•	Research-value (suitable for portfolio, scholarship applications, and interviews)
